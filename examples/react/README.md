# State Pilot React Example

This example demonstrates usage of State Pilot. Within the `/StatePilot` directory see `StatePilotInstance` singleton function with an instance of State Pilot within a class. The `SettingsStore` provides an example of how you can set up a new store and register it with State Pilot.
